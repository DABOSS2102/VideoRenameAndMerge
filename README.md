# VideoRenameAndMerge

## What is it

This is a program that takes a folder of videos, renames all the videos to the same name with a number after it, and creates a new video of all the videos combined into one.

## Why I made it

Even though I am out of college, I still do track and field throwing, more specifically, hammer and weight. I record my throws during practice on my phone, and I need to upload them so my coach can view them. When exporting videos from your phone, the video name is just the date and time of when it was recorded. It got annoying to constantly change the name of the video so it was readable for my coach, so I created this to rename them for me. I also wanted to combine all the videos so I could upload it to youtube easily for some free video storage.

## Why use Python

To be completely honest, I don't know. It seemed like it had the most video editing libraries available, and I thought it would be fun to play around with a language I don't use often.

## Why should you use it

I don't know why anyone would need to use this program other than me. It was specifically designed for my use case, but I wanted it to be saved somewhere other than my computer. Since I chose to put it on GitHub publicly, I decided it would be best to do it somewhat nicely.

## I hope you enjoy!
